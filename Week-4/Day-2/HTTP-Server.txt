Notes:

1. HTTP Protocols - An HTTP request is a message sent by a client to a server to trigger an action, and HTTP is the Hypertext Transfer Protocol that defines how data is exchanged between a client and server on the internet
2. Request response model - The request-response model is a fundamental communication pattern. It describes how data is exchanged between a `client` and a `server` or between two systems.
3. Domain names - The way to reach a sever is through its `Domain name` . For example: 
        i.google.com
        ii. app.100xdevs.com
        iii. x.com

4. IPs - Every domain that we see, actually has an underlying IP that it `resolves` to. You can check the ip by running the `ping` command.
5. Ports - Port is a virtual point that manages network connections and directs data to a specific service. Ports are software-based and managed by a computer's operating system
6. Methods - HTTP methods are used to specify the type of action that the client wants to perform on a resource on the server.
        Common methods
            i. GET -  Retrieve data from a server. (Get my TODOS)
            ii. POST - Submit data to be processed by a server. (Create a TODO)
            iii. PUT - Update or create a resource on the server (Update my todo)
            iv. DELETE - Remove a resource from the server. (Delete my todo)
