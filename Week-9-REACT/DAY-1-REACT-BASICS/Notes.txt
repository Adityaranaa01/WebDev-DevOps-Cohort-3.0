Notes: 

- React is just an easier way to write normal HTML/CSS/JS. It’s a new syntax, that under the hood gets converted to HTML/CSS/JS.

1. Why React?
    - People realised it’s harder to do DOM manipulation the conventional way.
    - There were libraries that came into the picture that made it slightly easy, but still for a very big app it’s very hard (JQuery).
    - Eventually, VueJS/React created a new syntax to do frontends.
    - Under the hood, the react compiler convert your code to HTML/CSS/JS.

2. State & Components:
    - To create a react app, you usually need to worry about two things. Creators of frontend frameworks realised that all websites can effectively be divided into two parts :
        i. State
        ii. Component 

3. State / Component Re-rendering: 
    i. State : 
        - Everything in a website that changes is a state. An object that represents the current state of the app.
        - It represents the dynamic things in your app (things that change).
        - For example, the value of the counter.
    
    ii. Components :
        - How a DOM element should render, given a state.
        - It is a re-usable, dynamic, HTML snippet that changes given the state.
