Notes:

1. Single page applications, routing:

    Single Page Applications (SPAs) are web applications that load a single HTML page and dynamically update that page as the user interacts with the app. This approach allows for a smoother user experience compared to traditional multi-page applications (MPAs), where each interaction often requires a full page reload.
