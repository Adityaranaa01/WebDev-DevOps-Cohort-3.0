Notes:

1. Single page applications, routing:
    - Single Page Applications (SPAs) are web applications that load a single HTML page and dynamically update that page as the user interacts with the app. This approach allows for a smoother user experience compared to traditional multi-page applications (MPAs), where each interaction often requires a full page reload.

2. Layouts in React:
    - Layouts in React refer to reusable components that define the structure and organization of the UI by arranging headers, footers, sidebars, and content areas. They ensure consistency across the application by wrapping child components within a shared structural framework. Layouts can be customized and nested to support different sections of an application and are often integrated with tools like CSS or libraries like React Router for dynamic routing and styling.
    - Code {Example} :
            
        // Layout Component
        const Layout = ({ children }) => {
        return (
            <div>
            <header>Header</header>
            <main>{children}</main>
            <footer>Footer</footer>
            </div>
        );
        };

        // Using the Layout
        const App = () => {
        return (
            <Layout>
            <h1>Welcome to My App</h1>
            </Layout>
        );
        };

        export default App;
